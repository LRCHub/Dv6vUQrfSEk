Who was I when you loved me?
Who was I?
Who were you when I loved you?
Babe, it's you
I don't think I know

I was different but you were too
Matching socks and old cartoons
Wish those days never changed
Who was I when you loved me?

Oh, I want you
Do you want me back?
Oh, I need you
Who was I?

Who was I when you loved me?
